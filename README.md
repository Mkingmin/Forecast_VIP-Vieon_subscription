# Executive summary of the project
The VIP VieON package has seen significant and ongoing fluctuations in subscription numbers over the past two years (from April 2021 to January 2023), making it challenging to predict viewer trends. This has created a need to forecast subscription trends for VIP VieON. Developing a forecasting model that considers external factors influencing accuracy can help VieON better plan its business strategies and marketing efforts for the next five months.
